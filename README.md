## Gulp-Template

#### Small template using GULP and various development methodologies.

1. Used technologies (HTML-preprocessor, CSS-preprocessor):
- **JADE** : is a terse language for writing HTML templates;
- **HAML** : is based on one primary principle: markup should be beautiful;
- **SLIM** : is a template language whose goal is reduce the syntax to the essential parts without becoming cryptic;
- **BEMHTML** : the main idea of BEM methodology is to speed development process up and ease the teamwork of developers;
- **BH** : is processor that converts BEMJSON to HTML. Or in other words a template engine;
- **HANDLEBARS** : provides the power necessary to let you build semantic templates effectively with no frustration;
- **normal HTML** : commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages;
- **SASS/SCSS** : is a scripting language that is interpreted into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself;
- **LESS** : is a dynamic style sheet language that can be compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and run on the client-side or server-side;
- **STYLUS** : EXPRESSIVE, DYNAMIC, ROBUST CSS;
- **REWORK** : CSS manipulations built on css, allowing you to automate vendor prefixing, create your own properties, inline images, anything you can imagine;

2. Additional features :
- image compress;
- svg/png sprite;
- convert SASS to SCSS & <=>;
- SASS/SCSS, JS documentation;


#### Ok. let's go

First you need to choose the technology that will be used to build the project (in terminal):

    #sudo chmod +x #{bash file name} => 'start-project.sh'
    ./start-project.sh

    #When you start you ask:

        Select HTML-preprocessor => [HAML, JADE, SLIM, BEMHTML, BH, HTML, HANDLEBARS] > jade
            Use JADE-/preprocessor in project!
        Select CSS-preprocessor  => [SASS, LESS, STYLUS, REWORK] > sass
            Use SASS-/preprocessor in project!

    #After selecting the technology, and the rest removed from the project
